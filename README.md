GitHub mirror script
====================

This script clones all the repositories *accessable to your user*, including
ones which you have contributed to but are not under your user (e.g.
repositories on an organisation you're part of). Works with private repos too!

Note that you'll need to generate an token, known in GitHub terms as a 'Personal
access token'. Pop over to [settings/token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
and generate one -- it only needs full repository permissions and (probably)
read access for organisations. Your username is linked to the token, so you
don't need to provide it.
